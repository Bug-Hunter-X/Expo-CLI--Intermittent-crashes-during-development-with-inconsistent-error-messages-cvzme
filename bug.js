While working on an Expo project, I encountered a peculiar issue where the application would crash intermittently during development. The error messages were inconsistent, making debugging extremely challenging. Sometimes, I'd see generic errors, and other times, the app would simply freeze without any clear indication of the problem. The issue seemed to be related to asynchronous operations and background tasks, as the crashes appeared to occur randomly, and not always on the same line of code.  I tried numerous solutions such as cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, restarting the device, etc., but none of them provided a permanent fix.
